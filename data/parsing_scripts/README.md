# Data Structure from VM's Zip Files

This repository contains Python scripts for extracting data from VM's zip files and converting them into a structured directory of CSV files.

## Getting Started

1. Extract the VM zip file to a folder. Your folder structure should look like this:

    ```
    VM_feb2023_{i}/
        |-VM_feb2023_{i}.csv
    ```

2. Copy  the Python script from this directory to the same folder. Your folder structure should now look like this:

    ```
    VM_feb2023_{i}/
        |-VM_feb2023_{i}.csv
    .
    .
    .
    parse_vm.ipynb
    ```

3. Run the Python scripts
    
Congratulations, you have now successfully extracted and structured the data from the VM's zip files!
