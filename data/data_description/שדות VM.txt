messageCreationTime: The VM transmitter creation time. The frequency of the update according to the requirement of the Ministry of Transport, broadcast every 15 seconds, even if the vehicle is not moving.
messageRecordingTime: The time when a new location was recorded after a move. The time will not be updated as long as the vehicle is stationary
tripStopRecordId: to be ignored, dropped later
messageReceiveTime: The time when the VM transmitter was received in Moran (Moran: name of the system).
operatorMessageId: to ignore, dropped later
realTimeMonitoringFailure: to ignore, dropped later
tripEndReasonCode: trip end message. Provides information and the trip did not go as planned. During a normal trip, "NormalTermination" will be displayed at the end.
coordinateX: latitude coordinate - WGS84
coordinateY: Longitudinal coordinate - WGS84
DatedVehicleJourneyRef: Equivalent to TripId A single-valued identifier of a trip combined with a date
VehicleRef: Vehicle identification plate number
bearing: direction in degrees relative to the north. Use really carefully, because I'm not always accurate, especially after a face.
velocity: Speed in km/h. It is highly recommended not to use, because this figure is not of high quality.
distanceFromStart: Distance in meters from the start of the trip. Distance between stations only and not between signal and the signal.
percentageFromStart: A percentage of the distance in passing near stations to speak of the total trip.
stopId: stop_code value of the current or last stop (in the GTFS stop table) where the vehicle was.
stopOrder: The order of the current or last stop the vehicle was at. Starts from 1, and corresponds to stop_sequence in the stop_times table in GTFS
stopOnRequest: to ignore, dropped later
actualArrivalTime: Time of entry to the current or last stop where the bus was
actualDepartureTime: Departure time from the current or last station where the bus was
aimedDepartureTime: Planned departure time. Can change if departure is delayed.
operatorId: operator code. Same as the value of agency_id,
vehicleAtStop: Is the vehicle at the stop. Calculated according to radius, and not really that the car is standing at the station. 100m distance range
